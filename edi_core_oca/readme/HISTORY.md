## 18.0.1.7.0 (2026-05-20)

### Features

- Introduce a new system for **global EDI events** based on ``edi.configuration``
  that can replace the use of component events.

  Any ``edi.configuration`` flagged as ``is_global`` is now picked up by
  ``EDIExchangeRecord._trigger_edi_event`` and its ``snippet_do`` is executed
  whenever the matching event fires (``done``, ``error``, ``ack_received``,
  ``ack_missing``, ``ack_received_error``, ``<action>_complete``, ...).

  Filtering is performed via the new ``edi.configuration.edi_get_conf_global``
  model method, which selects active global configurations matching the event
  trigger code and, when set, the exchange type, the backend and the related
  record model carried by the exchange record (empty values still mean "applies
  to all"). This lets integrators subscribe to EDI events declaratively from
  the UI instead of writing component listeners.

  Full test coverage is included for the dispatch on all ``notify_*`` events
  (both on the exchange record and on the related record target) and for the
  new filtering rules.

  Last but not lease: add minimal docs for edi.configuration. ([#global-edi-conf-events](https://github.com/OCA/edi-framework/issues/global-edi-conf-events))
