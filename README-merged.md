# Fiscal Rules (multi-criteria decision tables)

With its fiscal position mapping, Odoo may have a limited ability to apply the proper taxes and mapping depending on the context, for instance country of origin and destination of the goods and this could put the fiscal burden on the salesperson, not to speak about e-commerce where things should be automatic. This extensible framework makes it possible to select the proper fiscal position to apply according to an extensible flat decision table.

# MIS Builder

Management Information System reports for Odoo: easily build super fast,
beautiful, custom reports such as P&L, Balance Sheets and more.

**This is the 13.0 branch. Please note the development of new features occurs mainly on
the 10.0 branch, to be forward-ported to 13.0. Please submit pull requests to the 10.0
branch in priority, unless they are 13.0 specific bugs, or they rely on
Odoo features that are not present in 10.0.**

This project implements a class of reports where KPI (Key Performance Indicators)
are displayed in rows, and time periods in columns. It focuses on very fast reporting
on accounting data but can also use data from any other Odoo model.

It features the following key characteristics:

- User configurable: end users can create new report templates without development,
  using simple Excel-like formulas.
- Very fast balance reporting for accounting data, even on million lines databases
  and very complex account charts.
- Use the same template for different reports.
- Compare data over different time periods.
- User-configurable styles, rendered perfectly in the UI as well as Excel and PDF exports.
- Interactive display with drill-down.
- Export to PDF and Excel.
- A budgeting module.
- Evaluate KPI over various data sources, such as actuals, simulation, committed costs
  (some custom development is required to create the data source).
- For developers, the accounting balance computation engine is exposed as an easy
  to use API.

Here are some presentations:

- Odoo Experience 2017 ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/acsone/budget-control-with-misbuilder-3-2017), [video](https://youtu.be/0PpxGAf2l-0))
- Odoo Experience 2016 ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/acsone/misbuilder-2016))
- Odoo Experience 2015 ([slides](https://www.slideshare.net/acsone/misbuilder))

  1. Refuse the Claim (e.g. out of warranty)
  1. Return the customer's goods and send new ones in 2 click
  1. Send the goods to the supplier
  1. Refund the customer


Main modules:

***product_warranty***
Extend the warranty details to product/supplier form
* supplier warranty
* return product to company, supplier, brand
* return instructions

***crm_claim_rma***

* product refund
* product exchange
* access to related customer data (orders, invoices, refunds, picking in/out)

## Dynamic routing of operation

Classify operation depending on where they are reserved, manage handover places, creates different goods flow by carriers. Route explains the steps you want to produce whereas the “picking routing operation” defines how operations are grouped according to their final source
and destination location.

## Packaging management

To better manage the product packaging we need to have them properly defined for each product and classify them by type. Most common type are usually:
 - Retail box
 - Transport box
 - Pallet

It is a basic requirement for improved reservation rules, efficient barcode operation and usage of measurement machines such as Cubiscan for example.

## Put away based on storage type, ABC class and constraints (height, weight,..)

Define storage type on location and attribute storage type on PACK. Storage type can also be define on product packaging to help filling up the info while receiving products.
The idea is that anything getting in the warehouse is given a unique PACK ID with proper storage type and attributes (height, weight, etc..). Product are classified in A,B,C Class as well as location depending on their accessibility for optimized chaotic storage.
Put away will then compute the proper location based on those information.

## Reservation rules by packaging and location

Provide configurable reservation rule by location and packaging type with sequence. Thus allows to drive reservation differently depending on the packaging type to retrieve. For example, pick first pallets from Location A and then boxes from location B. 

It supports several removal strategies: default FIFO/FEFO prefer packaging or empty bin to favor emptying spaces over anything else.

## Virtual reservation and release of operations

Make the final stock reservation when needed, decoupled from the order confirmation while respecting the order of arrival through virtual reservation. Thus also helps to create internal operations such as pick or ship when required only. 

When operation release occurs, only create moves for the goods we have in stocks. This will avoid having backorder in internal warehouse operations (only the delivery order will have one).

## Delivery windows, weekly delivery and cut-off time

Define delivery windows for your customers where they can receive your goods. Setup weekly day of delivery if required. Handle cut-off time by customer depending on where they are.

## Group and consolidate your shipment for several orders

Group several orders into one consolidated shipment by carrier during packing operations.

## Manage replenishment zone

Re-allocate your needs for stocks to drive your replenishment operations within your location (from a pallet storage to a shelving one for example). This allows you to re-allocate a missing stock quantity to a given location to wait for stock there while performing replenishment (technically, it allows to change the source of a stock move to make it hit a stock rule).

## Advanced barcode scanner

Decouple transactional Odoo documents and flows toward an efficient shop-floor process. Do not rely on finding the proper operation to process, but scan location and package to deduce what to do with it. Proceed with operation by machine type or zone rather than Odoo document. Get optimized path computed properly.

Configure your barcode menu, chose which scanning process to apply to each operation, allow to process several operation type within a same barcode menu.

Provide state of the art logistics features to handle zero checks, inventory errors and stock out, etc..

## Warehouse map

Allow to represent the warehouse map precisely by defining relevant attributes and naming convention. Thus will also constitute a per-requisit for having a proper path computed while making an optimized picking tour.

## Interface with measurement machine

Here with Cubiscan, but interface might serve as a base for other brand.

## Interface with vertical automated storage

Provide the proper interface and link to connect vertical lift machines such as Kardex.

## Minimum shelf-life

Ensure a minimum shelf life to your customers.

## Manage dangerous goods

Handle proper attributes and report for dangerous goods handling in respect to EU legislation.

# Business Requirement Management

This repository concentrates features for Business Analysis in general, and Business Requirements in particular.

The Business Requirements features start as independent entities, and can be used as standalone.
Additional modules integrate them with other business areas, such as Sales, Procurement, Project or Analytic Accounting.
So a Quotation can have an estimation supported by a BR analysis, and Project Tasks can be related to the BRs they implement or support.

# OCA alternative reporting engines and reporting utilities for Odoo

This repository hosts alternative reporting engines to the ones included on Odoo core (RML, QWeb and Webkit).

The convention is to use a suffix to each module to indicate that it's for using with that report engine (for example, account_invoice_report_birt or sale_order_report_pentaho).

It can contain also another utilities directly involved with reports (like merge/split utils, checkers, signing tools and so on).

# Community Data Files

This project is a collection of Odoo modules containing various data files that are too big to fit the official addons or the other Community projects.

Such data files may include for example tax tables, lists of ZIP codes, official activity nomenclatures...

This project is the continuation of OpenERP-Nomenclatures, which had a narrower scope limited to only official files provided by government agencies.

This project aim to develop and publish all modules related to the need of
humanitarian NGOs. It would cover the overall needs in terms of logistics,
order management, accounting, transportation and distribution.

Main changes are made in the procurement standard flow of Odoo. Usually, you
have sales that drive procurement, that drive purchase. With those modules, you
record logistic requisition to capture the needs, you source them from one way
or another (purchase, stock, donnation,..) and give back to the requestor the
price, time and product information. If he agree with, then you confirm the
requisition by creating an offer. The offer will drive all the necessary flows
to deliver the goods where they are needed. It also improves the purchase
requisition flow to fit more with the NGO's problematic.

In the future, it'll cover other NGO's specific needs such as the distribution,
transportation, finance (donations, donors report,.. ), volonteer management,..

You'll find here :
----------------------

- NGO Addons: That contain the module specific to the NGO world (currently
  management of logistic reuquisition, kind of need registring and sourcing
  tools)
