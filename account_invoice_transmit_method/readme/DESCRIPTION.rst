This module allows to configure an *Invoice Transmit Method* on each partner.
This module provides by default 3 transmission methods:

* E-mail
* Post
* Customer Portal

You can manually create additionnal transmission methods or other modules can create
additionnal transmission methods (for example, the module *l10n_fr_chorus_account*
creates a specific transmission method *Chorus Pro*, which is the e-invoicing plateform
of the French administration).

When we select “Post” or “Customer Portal,” the button to send and print disappears.
To reactivate the send and print button, you will need to change the transmission 
method to “E-Mail,” and from there you can choose whether you want to send and print, 
or just one of the two options.
